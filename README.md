# ts-react-starter

This is a very basic starter project for [reactjs](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). I built this to bootstrap my own projects and hopefully help others do the same in this crazy world of reactjs and [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

# overview

This project uses:

* [reactjs](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
